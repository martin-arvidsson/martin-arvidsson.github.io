#### Bio


I am currently a postdoc at the [Institute for Analytical Sociology](https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/iei/ias).

#### Research Interests

Much of my research centers on how individuals come to influence on another, and how individuals in interaction bring about different collective outcomes (e.g., segregation, inequality). In this research, I combine the principles of analytical sociology with the tools and data from computational social science.

#### Education
2017-2022 Ph.D. in Analytical Sociology, Linköping University, Sweden. Supervised by [Peter Hedström](https://liu.se/en/employee/pethe05) and [Marc Keuschnigg](https://keuschnigg.org/).<br/>
2015 MS in Statistics, Linköping University, Sweden<br/>
