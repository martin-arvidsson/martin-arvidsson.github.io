#### Bio


I am currently a postdoc at the [Institute for Analytical Sociology](https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/iei/ias).

#### Research interests

Much of my research centers on how individuals come to influence one another, and how individuals in interaction bring about different collective outcomes (e.g., segregation, inequality). In this research, I combine the principles of analytical sociology with the tools and data from computational social science.
